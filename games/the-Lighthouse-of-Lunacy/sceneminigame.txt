"Just when she had entered the room, she heard the gunshots and turned around to rush back."

"...but she still noticed that Mr. Cova and Dr. Hellinger eventually entered the room behind her."

"Once Dr. Hellinger caught up, she took lead of the investigation."

"She certainly made it sound like she was very thorough in each room."
"Once satisfied that everything had been searched, the three of them returned upstairs via the elevator."
"I can keep the investigation in mind, but..."
"...for now, the end point of my timeline should be everyone being gathered at the scene."
