char lilian hide
"Well,{p15} if he starts revealing stuff irrelevant to his job then yeah,{p15} Lance is a jackass."
"{sfx idea}While that behaviour can be debatable,{p15} it's at least based on the truth:{p30} objective fact."
"{sfx huh}But what happens if Lance does anything else?"
"{sfx key2}Once he chooses to distort the truth instead,{p15} whatever happens would be entirely his fault."
"If he told someone a lie and that person commits suicide because of it,{p15} it's definitely partly his fault."
"His motives wouldn't even matter."
