"From the sound of it, there was a pretty decent chance you wouldn't make it today."

"{f10}I suppose you still took the easy route,{p15} though.{p30} You didn't go to the hairdresser."
char aurelia hide
"{sfx huh}...Hold up.{p30} Are you implying a hairdresser is worse than a dentist?"
char lilian e=wink
"That's a given now,{p15} isn't it?"

"{sfx waaah}How does that check out?"

"Scissors are objectively more dangerous than some tiny drill."
char aurelia hide
"{sfx anger}They're cutting your hair.{p30} There's literally no pain involved."
char lilian e=nuhuh
"Ah,{p15} but you see...{p50} what if they pull?{p30} What if they cut into your head?"
char aurelia hide
"Did that EVER happen?"
char lilian e=normal
"Not sure.{p30} But it could."
char lilian e=nuhuh
"Worst case,{p15} you might get decapitated.{p30} Can you get decapitated at the dentist?"
char aurelia hide
"{sfx waaah}No,{p15} but I'd still say it's much more likely to die there than when your hair gets cut."
char lilian e=normal
"Oh yeah?{p30} Name three mystery novels where someone dies in a dentist chair."
char aurelia hide
"...How am I supposed to know?{p30} There's probably one by Christie or something."
char lilian e=nuhuh
"Now,{p15} how many novels do exist where someone gets killed with scissors?"
char aurelia hide
"Sure,{p15} just set the bar lower for yourself."
char lilian e=normal
"Well,{p15} you just won't see the light.{p30} Let's postpone this discussion."

"You still haven't told me what this trip is actually about."
"You told the {sfx huh}{c r}Queens of Crime{c w} that you're going to some auction."
char aurelia hide
"Right,{p15} and that's when you randomly decided to show up on my train."
char lilian e=normal
"I mean,{p15} I had a feeling this was going to be good.{p30} Besides,{p15} we haven't met in a while."
