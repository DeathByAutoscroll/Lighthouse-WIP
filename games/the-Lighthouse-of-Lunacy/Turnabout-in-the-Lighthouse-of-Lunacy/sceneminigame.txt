"Lilian and Mr. Gardt went to the Justice room upon arrival on the floor."
"After searching the room, they split up. I will consider this moment her initial position."
"While Mr. Gardt went to take a second look, Lilian went to the Autonomy room."
"She says she moved there counter-clockwise."
"Curiously, no traces of this were discovered on the dusty shelf she must have climbed over."
"Just when she had entered the room, she heard the gunshots and turned around to rush back."
"Back in Justice, she found {n}Mr. Gardt's dead body. {n}{p20}Nobody else in sight."
"This put her in shock..."
"...but she still noticed that Mr. Cova and Dr. Hellinger eventually entered the room behind her."
"After that, she stuck together with the others for the investigation."

"Mr. Cova and Dr. Hellinger entered the Beneficence room upon arrival."
"They left the door open and ensured nobody could pass through the hallway unnoticed."
"When the gunshots happened, {n}Mr. Cova rushed out first."
"Dr. Hellinger says she didn't want to leave her HUNT devices behind, which delayed her."
"Cova says he caught a glimpse of Lilian in the door to Justice."
"When he arrived at the room himself, he saw her again, in front of Mr. Gardt's dead body."
"Once Dr. Hellinger caught up, she took lead of the investigation."
"From there, she investigated the floor in clockwise order."
"She certainly made it sound like she was very thorough in each room."
"Once satisfied that everything had been searched, the three of them returned upstairs via the elevator."
"I can keep the investigation in mind, but..."
"...for now, the end point of my timeline should be everyone being gathered at the scene."

"Mariko says she dropped down a ventilation shaft and passed out for a while."
"When she woke up, she found herself in "a room full of ears", which appears to match Autonomy."
"I will treat the room she woke up in as her initial position."
"She moved into the hallway and approached the shelf to her left."
"On the other side, she saw "the Star" {p20}(Lilian){p20} enter the door with the mouth."
"That would be the door to the Justice room."
"Then, she heard the gunshots and panicked."
"She hit her head against the shelf, briefly not watching the door."
"About minute or so later, she saw Dr. Hellinger and Mr. Cova arrive."
"Or in her words, "the doctor and the candyman"..."
"They entered the same room as Lilian, in close succession."
"Mariko then got scared and ran back into the room she came from, Autonomy."
"She claims this room was to the East, but that would not align with our map."
"Which does suggest the layout may not be quite what we assumed, but..."
"I should ignore that and simply consider the position of these rooms in relation to the scene."
