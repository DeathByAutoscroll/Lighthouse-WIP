"No.{p30} That room was obviously off-limits.{p30} I've got to admit that."

"There were some things I was looking for.{p30} And yeah,{p15} I probably would have stolen them."

"{sfx ohno}But the auction manager just came at me out of nowhere!"

"{sfx huh}...Later?"

"You can certainly be blamed for things here.{p30} But murder?{p30} No way!"

setvar _speaking aurelia

"{sfx anger}That won't fly and you know it!"

setvar _speaking lilian

"...It will be hard to prove.{p30} You were trespassing,{p15} after all."
"{sfx huh}If that is established,{p15} the law won't be in your favor."
emo side
"You also had a gun,{p15} while the victim only had a knife."
"People won't buy she just kept coming at you after you pointed a gun at her."
emo wink
"It would be tough to claim self-defense in such circumstances."

setvar _speaking aurelia

"I know how it sounds.{p30} But it's what happened.{p30} What else am I supposed to claim?"

"Weren't you going on about truth earlier?{p30} I've got no choice but to come clean."

setvar _speaking lilian

"{sfx huh}...How about you go back what you did earlier?"

setvar _speaking aurelia

"{sfx waaah}What?"

setvar _speaking lilian

"How did you avoid my questions when I kept pestering you?"
"Nobody is gonna buy this story of yours."

"{sfx huh}The fifth?{p30} You want me...{p50} to just say nothing at all?"

setvar _speaking lilian

"As the accused,{p15} it is your right not to testify against yourself."
"You apparently can't say the truth,{p15} and lying would be stupid.{p30} So that's your only option."
