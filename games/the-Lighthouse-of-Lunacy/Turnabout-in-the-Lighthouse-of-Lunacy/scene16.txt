"You wouldn't be worth haunting."

char ??? hide
"Don't give me that look.{p30} Be reasonable here."
"There's talk about preferential treatment."
"Those folks are right,{p15} I've been letting you get away with a lot."

"I don't believe I've done anything but my job."

char ??? hide
"{sfx anger}Your job?{p30} Your job is to deliver the goods."

char aurelia e=side
"And haven't I done that?"

char ??? hide
"To CONSISTENTLY deliver them.{p30} Come now,{p15} we both know it."
"I admire your ambition.{p30} I really do."
"You're clearly not satisfied with the low hanging fruit."
"Still,{p15} one can't always go swinging for the seats.{p30} Got to keep it realistic."
"But you keep going after these huge conspiracy theories."

char aurelia e=side
"Someone has to see if there's fire behind the smoke."

char ??? hide
"Look...{p50} I gotta keep it real with you."
"Even if there was a story there,{p15} how long do you think it's worth looking for it?"
"Is it worth looking into them for years just to have nothing to show for it?"
"'Cause that's pretty much what you've done!"
"I can't do this anymore,{p15} Chase.{p30} At some point I've got to think of our bottom line."
"And all that I see there is that you haven't done a thing."

char aurelia e=nervous
"...Wait."
"{sfx huh}Before you fire me,{p15} take a look at this."

"...Trade secret."

char ??? hide
"This...{p50} this will certainly be a big one."
"Sorry,{p15} Chase.{p30} I took you for another hopeless case."
"{sfx huh}Still,{p15} are you sure you want your name on this?"

char aurelia e=shock
"Why shouldn't I?"

char ??? hide
"I'm not saying you don't deserve credit.{p30} I'm just worried about your safety."
"{sfx idea}This is a dangerous criminal organization you're taking shots at here."
"You're mostly exposing the dead guy,{p15} but who knows how those kinda folks will take it."

char aurelia e=glare
"{sfx huh}It should be fine.{p30} That man was pretty much their leader,{p15} but that's the thing."

"I see.{p30} Well if you're not worried,{p15} I won't be."
"I'll still take some measures,{p15} remove your address from the records and stuff."
"If anyone wants to contact you over this,{p15} what should we do?"
