"The group had returned, {n}without Mr. Gardt."
"Thus, Dr. Hellinger was the one to fetch me for the trial."
"I think she performed the headcount as well, in Mr. Gardt's stead."
"Victoria informed us of Mr. Gardt's death, but tried to block it from being a point of discussion."
"And she succeeded, bringing in Mariko as a direct eyewitness instead."
"This ended up being a mistake for her, as it established Mrs. Holden had the cleaning spray."
"I managed to make a... {p15}decent case against Ms. Holden by arguing she could have poisoned the victim."
"That eventually got shot down by calling Dr. Hellinger."
"To top it all off, Victoria claimed she figured out where the key was."
"And indeed, the key was detected inside my stomach."
"To retrieve it, I had to go to the bathroom. {p20}Thankfully only Dr. Hellinger accompanied me for that."
"I tried to argue against it, but Victoria had a counter for everything."
"Not only that, she almost got me to confess to the crime."
"I was able to pull back by suggesting a theory with Lilian as the mastermind."
"We managed to get Ms. Holden to agree to the third-party complaint, so it barely worked."
"Lilian was put on the stand, and claimed she was in Autonomy when the crime happened."
"I pointed out how that's impossible due to the evidence and testimony."
"There was enough doubt about the testimony to call the next two witnesses."
"Mr. Cova and Dr. Hellinger. {p15}Neither seemed too pleased with what I was doing..."
"I didn't really put much of a dent in their alibi, and they were eventually dismissed."
"Thankfully, Lilian had another idea, and got Mariko on the stand again."
"I found several issues in her testimony, but nothing that overturned the case."
"But at the last second, I managed to expose that she couldn't have visited Luna Park."
"Not unless she lied about her age, at least."
"This led to quite a situation with Mr. Neland and Mr. Poly getting involved."
"Dr. Hellinger was luckily able to resolve that with her drone."
"Using the revelation about Mariko, I argued that the visitor numbers don't add up."
"...And we discovered that one guest on the list is not present."
"Naota Feykneme."
"Which brings us to the present..."
"Unless I can figure out who they are, there's no way I can use this to build a case."
"There are three conditions this culprit must meet."
"One, they were not present on the upper floor during the trial and investigation."
"Two, they were on the lower floor after the first murder, and were spotted by Mr. Poly."
"Three, they must have had a clear opportunity to plant the key."
"The first two conditions can rule out a few people, but it's really the third one that's important."
"Nobody will buy anything I say if they think I swallowed it myself."
"So I ought to {c r}look for an opportunity to plant the key{c w}, first and foremost."
"If it raises other questions, I can deal with those later."
"But if I don't have any explanation for that as a baseline, there's no way the judge will hear me out."

"For the rest, I'll have to rely on testimony and evidence."
"They split up. Lilian and Mr. Gardt searched the Justice room."
"After being satisfied there was nobody, the two of them left."
"Except, Mr. Gardt turned back, apparently having some instinct."
"But then all the testimonies become a mess and contradict each other."
"I can focus on what happened there later."
"For now I have to actually establish there's a Mr. X in the mix."

"Entering the display room, Lilian discovered the temperature there was now freezing."
"Regardless, she and Mr. Gardt spotted someone snooping around the room."
"It was Mr. Cova, who was in the middle of trying to solve the cube I solved earlier."
"Lilian confronted him and got him to confess his true identity."
"He's actually an FBI agent, tasked with retrieving the stuff Dr. Leid stole."
"It was him that spread the rumours of the curse."
"This was to minimize the chances another party would discover anything."
"Apparently, the owners of the tower hadn't been too cooperative."
"Which forced him to employ methods like that."
"After giving another warning, he left the display room."
"Lilian then discovered that Mr. Poly had been hiding behind the curtain."
"He was ice cold, so Mr. Gardt brought him a blanket."
"Then they questioned him about his previous testimony."
"Mr. Poly admitted he was looking for a certain treasure."
"The statuette of Thanatos, which would apparently fetch an unexpectedly high price."
"I reckon it might have actually been his daughter that set out to look for it..."
"And when the gunshot was heard, he got worried and tried to find her."
"Which led to him jumping out the window and seeing what he did."
"As for what he saw, it's clear it was too dark for him to tell if it was Dr. Leid for sure."
"Apparently, the cleaning platform was already aligned with the lower floor."
"He merely brought it back up after the fact."
"Mr. Gardt added that there is a maintenance hatch in the ceiling somewhere on this floor."
"That's how the window cleaners usually make it onto the platform."
"However, regular visitors probably have no way of accessing that."
"Mr. Poly also had some information about Luna Park."
"It is a subsidiary of Cool Company, a business focused on cooling systems."
"The company owner, Luna von Doppelbohringen, was also one of the guests in the BU2-incident."
"After her death, it was decided to name the park after her."
"Mr. Poly speculated that she could have had a connection to Dr. Leid."
"Apparently, her company also has some sketchy business records."
"This led him to talk about the victim having some questionable business as well."
"Mr. Poly was also the one to reveal where Ms. Holden got the cleaning spray from."
"That's about all Lilian managed to get out of him."

"She also assisted by analyzing the fingerprints on the cleaning spray."
"That's... {p20}apparently all they talked about?"

I wasn't allowed to leave the side
room again. I'll have to go by what
Lilian told me.
Aurelia
She was fortunately still allowed to
look around, albeit under Mr.
Gardt's watch.
Aurelia
They went over why nobody could
have been hidden on the lower
floor.
Aurelia
Well, I now know an extra person
could at least exist here, so those
points are moot.
Aurelia
How they got to the lower floor,
however, remains unsolved.
Aurelia
Supposedly that floor was kept
locked, with the elevator unable to
stop on it.
Aurelia
Only the manager and her daughter
would have had the means to let
someone in there.
Aurelia
Anyway, Ms. Holden announced her
plan to send a limited number of
people to the lower floor.
Aurelia
Lilian managed to convince her to
let her come along as well.
Aurelia
She also managed to confirm that
Susan gambled a bit too much for
her own good.
Aurelia
As the special cleaning spray
confirmed, she had gotten herself
into some debt.
Aurelia
No doubt the reason she is trying
to get money out of this trial...
Aurelia
That's about all Lilian told me she
learned here.

Trial resumed. Victoria was

Three of them at once, in fact. Mr.
Neland, Mr. Dowe, and Mr. Poly.
Aurelia
I drew attention to a blood trail,
but it was a trap set by Victoria.
Aurelia
However, I turned things around by
exposing that Mr. Poly didn't
witness the crime.
Aurelia
Instead, he had slipped off into the
display room and gone out the
window onto a suspended platform.
Aurelia
There, he heard a second gunshot,
and claimed to have seen Dr. Leid
on the lower floor.
Aurelia
This sent the trial into complete

We took a detour into the display
room, accompanied by Mr. Gardt.
Aurelia
The room has a No Entry sign, but
evidently wasn't locked, either.
Aurelia
I felt a chill at the time, no doubt
the hole in the window was already
there.
Aurelia
However, Mr. Gardt stopped us
from touching the curtain at the
time.
Aurelia
At least we were allowed to collect
some other evidence.
Aurelia
I solved a puzzle cube, revealing a
message pointing us towards the
knife.
Aurelia
We then discovered another
message tucked away within the
sheath.
Aurelia
Only I know what that message
means. I don't think it's relevant
here...

At the scene, we ran into Dr.
Hellinger, still at work.
Aurelia
She didn't want me to be there, but
we managed to convince her with
Mr. Gardt's help.
Aurelia
I looked around the room and got
my evidence up to date.
Aurelia
Unfortunately, that included an
updated autopsy confirming my gun
fired the shot.
Aurelia
Dr. Hellinger explained her special
position.
Aurelia
She's a private detective working
for an organization called Alathea.
Aurelia
Apparently, they have been
granted privileges to assist with
investigations.
Aurelia
There are a lot of detectives
working for them, and they are
being ranked on their results.
Aurelia
The really good ones even receive
titles based on how they go about
their investigations.
Aurelia
For example, there is one called the
"Assistant Detective".
Aurelia
Sounds like somebody I could use
right now.
Aurelia
She joined them after finishing her
degree.
Aurelia
Given her title, it must have been a
doctoral degree, huh?
Aurelia
She told us about her HUNT
devices, her main method of
investigation.
Aurelia
"Hardly Understandable New
Technology".
Aurelia
She said it stands for that.
I'm not sure I buy it....
Aurelia
The creator of these devices is a
certain Ayako Kuroyama, who
works for ShimaraTech.
Aurelia
Dr. Hellinger painted her as some
kind of genius, but that's all I know
about her.
Aurelia
Some of the devices seem to be
having issues due to the jamming
signals.
Aurelia
That's more or less all she told us.
The rest is in the evidence.

In the main hall, we ran into Ms.
Holden and Mr. Cova.
Aurelia
The latter was urging the former to
call this off.
Aurelia
No doubt he was worried about not
being able to cover up the
evidence.
Aurelia
Trapping everyone increased the
chances someone would find
another dangerous weapon.
Aurelia
Ms. Holden wouldn't have it. In
retrospect, I wonder if she knew
his true reasons all along.
Aurelia
We heard a gunshot. We learned
that was Dr. Hellinger firing a shot
with my gun to compare it.
Aurelia
I tried to talk to her, but she ran
off.
Aurelia
Instead, Mr. Gardt showed up to
keep tabs on our movements.
Aurelia
We used the chance to get some
info out of him.
Aurelia
There were plans to call him to the
stand, but they were saved for
later.
Aurelia
Big mistake...
Aurelia
He had been kept quite busy by the
plaintiff's team.
Aurelia
They had requested all his visitor
logs, not just those from today.
Aurelia
They double checked there were
no discrepancies in any of them, it
seems.
Aurelia
Well, I've found the discrepancy
already. Naota Feykneme.
Aurelia
After this, he was stationed at the
scene with Dr. Hellinger.
Aurelia
He remained there until the trial
began. Victoria ordered him to do a
headcount.
Aurelia
He didn't know who the next
witnesses were going to be.
Well, I got hindsight for that.
Aurelia
The most interesting info was
about the victim herself.
Aurelia
Mrs. Holden hadn't left the tower
very often recently.
Aurelia
He speculated it was to dispel
worries of the curse, but I doubt
that.
Aurelia
If it was the goal, it clearly wasn't
working out too well.
Aurelia
He underlined that with a story
about how a man in a boat had
tried to "fight" the tower.
Aurelia
Mrs. Holden's daughter helped her
out in this tower. Probably kept it
clean.
Aurelia
It's unclear if she basically lived
here as well, though.
Aurelia
Apparently, her mother had been
quite strict, pushing most of the
menial work on her.
Aurelia
That's more or less all we learned
from him, so we moved on.

collapsed forward on the floor.
Aurelia
I was in shock, so it's hard to
remember the details here, but...
Aurelia
Guests came knocking at the door,
and eventually busted it open.
Aurelia
The two at the forefront were Mr.
Neland and Mr. Dowe.
Aurelia
Mr. Neland demanded my gun and
confirmed one bullet was missing.
Aurelia
They were about to approach the
body, but Ms. Holden interrupted
them.
Aurelia
I was so out of it that I don't
remember much of what happened
next.
Aurelia
But going by later testimony,
Susan approached the body
herself.
Aurelia
While apparently mourning her
mother, she stole the cleaning
spray off her body.
Aurelia
I was brought to the side room by
Mr. Neland and Lilian.
Aurelia
Dr. Hellinger was called to the
scene and began setting up her
devices.
Aurelia
Mr. Dowe remained with her initially,
but was eventually replaced by Mr.
Gardt.
Aurelia
And thus, the investigation began...

We got to the main hall.
The auction was about to start.
Aurelia
Most of the guests were wearing
suits, making me feel out of place.
Aurelia
I tried baiting Lilian into trying
spicy curry from the buffet.
She didn't bite.
Aurelia
The auction began. Mrs. Holden
introduced herself and denounced
Dr. Leid.
Aurelia
Most items were brought to her by
her daughter, who had made sure
to keep them clean.
Aurelia
She played up the macabre past
each item may possess.
Aurelia
Her strategy worked, and
outlandish bids were thrown
around...
Aurelia
After about two hours, she
announced a 30-minute break.
Aurelia
She previewed the next item for
sale, that sheathed combat knife.
Aurelia
I managed to lose Lilian in the
crowd and made my way to the
study.

To get to the auction floor, we had
to go past the guard at the
entrance.
Aurelia
He asked for our IDs and that we
step through a metal detector.
Aurelia
Lilian remembered to take off her
pendant, but I forgot about my gun
and triggered the alarm.
Aurelia
Despite that, the guard was fine
with letting me keep my weapon
after I showed it to him.
Aurelia
He only made sure to add a note of
it in his logs, as per his
instructions.
Aurelia
He then let us proceed without
further complications.

We arrived in Monica Town and
went to the lighthouse.
Aurelia
Ander Cova approached us,
pretending to be a sweets
merchant.
Aurelia
I gave in and bought a cake from
him. The Cova Strawberry Crisis.
Aurelia
He claimed it had a secret recipe,
but Lilian later exposed that as
false.
Aurelia
He had just bought it from some
store somewhere. Still a good
cake, though.
Aurelia
Cova mentioned there's high
tourism in the area...
Aurelia
...thanks to nearby Luna Park and
the beautiful coasts.
Aurelia
He then explained why he
disapproved of the auction.
Aurelia
The previous owner died in the
BU-2 incident five years ago.
Aurelia
This happened while he was
attending a dinner party hosted by
a certain Mr. Ost.
Aurelia
Everyone in that mansion was
declared dead by the police.
Aurelia
Though they never showed any
bodies to the public.
Aurelia
Their main suspect was another
one of the guests, a female lawyer.
Aurelia
I'm unsure how they concluded
that with no bodies. Clearly they're
hiding something.
Aurelia
Anyway, in the following years,
two more people had died after
visiting the tower.
Aurelia
As a result, the building had been
called cursed.
Aurelia
He also added tales about the eyes
on the tower looking at you at
night.
Aurelia
Really trying to sell it to us there.
Well, I likely figured out the true
nature of the curse already.
Aurelia
He only wanted to make sure
nobody picked up another
dangerous item.
Aurelia
We ignored his warning and
entered the tower anyway.

Lilian and I were catching up during
the train ride to the auction.
Aurelia
She had shown up out of nowhere
earlier that day to accompany me.
Aurelia
Probably just another case of her
intuition...
Aurelia
Anyway, we were mostly talking
about how our weeks went.
Aurelia
I had had a really unpleasant
encounter with my dentist the day
before...
Aurelia
...so we had a silly debate about
dentists and hairdressers.
Aurelia
She had also run into my sister the
other day, from the sound of it.
Aurelia
Sarah is still working for... I don't
want to call him a detective.
Aurelia
She's trying to work out a certain
serial killer case involving a cursed
computer file.
Aurelia
I didn't want her to keep doing
that, but I'm unsure how I feel
about it now.
Aurelia
Meanwhile, Lilian got involved in
another incident in the last few
weeks.
Aurelia
Someone got defenestrated in her
apartment building.
Aurelia
How does she keep managing that?
Aurelia
We also talked about the other
Queens of Crime.
Aurelia
There's Claire. She set up a VR
server for us, all with complete 3D
models.
Aurelia
Always so resourceful. She'd
probably have solved this case by
now.
Aurelia
Ex-Queen Victoria Priston... Well, I
think nothing else needs to be said
about her.
Aurelia
We replaced her with our newest
member, 'Yevpraksiya', aka the
russian spider.
Aurelia
We call her that because of the
name and the avatar, but actually
don't know where she's from.
Aurelia
She can be a bit much, but I trust
Claire's recommendation.
Aurelia
I get along with her fine, but Lilian
doesn't seem to trust her.
Not too surprising.
Aurelia
Lastly, we talked about the
auction, but I dodged most of her
questions.
