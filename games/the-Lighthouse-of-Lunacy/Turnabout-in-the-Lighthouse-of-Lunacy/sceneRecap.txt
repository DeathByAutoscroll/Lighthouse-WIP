"The group had returned,{p15} {n}without Mr Gardt."
"Thus,{p15} Dr Hellinger was the one to fetch me for the trial."
"I think she performed the headcount as well,{p15} in Mr Gardt's stead."
"Victoria informed us of Mr Gardt's death,{p15} but tried to block it from being a point of discussion."
"And she succeeded,{p15} bringing in Mariko as a direct eyewitness instead."
"This ended up being a mistake for her,{p15} as it established Mrs Holden had the cleaning spray."
"I managed to make a... {p30}decent case against Ms Holden by arguing she could have poisoned the victim."
"That eventually got shot down by calling Dr Hellinger."
"To top it all off,{p15} Victoria claimed she figured out where the key was."
"And indeed,{p15} the key was detected inside my stomach."
"To retrieve it,{p15} I had to go to the bathroom. {p30}Thankfully only Dr. Hellinger accompanied me for that."
"I tried to argue against it,{p15} but Victoria had a counter for everything."
"Not only that,{p15} she almost got me to confess to the crime."
"I was able to pull back by suggesting a theory with Lilian as the mastermind."
"We managed to get Ms Holden to agree to the third-party complaint,{p15} so it barely worked."
"Lilian was put on the stand,{p15} and claimed she was in Autonomy when the crime happened."
"I pointed out how that's impossible due to the evidence and testimony."
"There was enough doubt about the testimony to call the next two witnesses."
"Mr Cova and Dr Hellinger. {p15}Neither seemed too pleased with what I was doing..."
"I didn't really put much of a dent in their alibi,{p15} and they were eventually dismissed."
"Thankfully,{p15} Lilian had another idea,{p15} and got Mariko on the stand again."
"I found several issues in her testimony,{p15} but nothing that overturned the case."
"But at the last second,{p15} I managed to expose that she couldn't have visited Luna Park."
"Not unless she lied about her age,{p15} at least."
"This led to quite a situation with Mr Neland and Mr Poly getting involved."
"Dr Hellinger was luckily able to resolve that with her drone."
"Using the revelation about Mariko,{p15} I argued that the visitor numbers don't add up."
"...And we discovered that one guest on the list is not present."
"Naota Feykneme."
"Which brings us to the present..."
"Unless I can figure out who they are,{p15} there's no way I can use this to build a case."
"There are three conditions this culprit must meet."
"One,{p15} they were not present on the upper floor during the trial and investigation."
"Two,{p15} they were on the lower floor after the first murder,{p15} and were spotted by Mr. Poly."
"Three,{p15} they must have had a clear opportunity to plant the key."
"The first two conditions can rule out a few people,{p15} but it's really the third one that's important."
"Nobody will buy anything I say if they think I swallowed it myself."
"So I ought to {c r}look for an opportunity to plant the key{c w},{p15} first and foremost."
"If it raises other questions,{p15} I can deal with those later."
"But if I don't have any explanation for that as a baseline,{p15} there's no way the judge will hear me out."

"These were Lilian,{p15} Dr Hellinger,{p15} Mr Cova,{p15} and Mr Gardt."
"For the rest,{p15} I'll have to rely on testimony and evidence."
"They split up. Lilian and Mr Gardt searched the Justice room."
"After being satisfied there was nobody,{p15} the two of them left."
"Except,{p15} Mr Gardt turned back,{p15} apparently having some instinct."
"But then all the testimonies become a mess and contradict each other."
"I can focus on what happened there later."
"For now I have to actually establish there's a Mr X in the mix."

"Regardless,{p15} she and Mr Gardt spotted someone snooping around the room."
"It was Mr Cova,{p15} who was in the middle of trying to solve the cube I solved earlier."
"Lilian confronted him and got him to confess his true identity."
"He's actually an FBI agent,{p15} tasked with retrieving the stuff Dr Leid stole."
"It was him that spread the rumours of the curse."
"This was to minimize the chances another party would discover anything."
"Apparently,{p15} the owners of the tower hadn't been too cooperative."
"Which forced him to employ methods like that."
"After giving another warning,{p15} he left the display room."
"Lilian then discovered that Mr Poly had been hiding behind the curtain."
"He was ice cold,{p15} so Mr Gardt brought him a blanket."
"Then they questioned him about his previous testimony."
"Mr Poly admitted he was looking for a certain treasure."
"The statuette of Thanatos,{p15} which would apparently fetch an unexpectedly high price."
"I reckon it might have actually been his daughter that set out to look for it..."
"And when the gunshot was heard,{p15} he got worried and tried to find her."
"Which led to him jumping out the window and seeing what he did."
"As for what he saw,{p15} it's clear it was too dark for him to tell if it was Dr. Leid for sure."
"Apparently,{p15} the cleaning platform was already aligned with the lower floor."
"He merely brought it back up after the fact."
"Mr Gardt added that there is a maintenance hatch in the ceiling somewhere on this floor."
"That's how the window cleaners usually make it onto the platform."
"However,{p15} regular visitors probably have no way of accessing that."
"Mr Poly also had some information about Luna Park."
"It is a subsidiary of Cool Company,{p15} a business focused on cooling systems."
"The company owner,{p15} Luna von Doppelbohringen,{p15} was also one of the guests in the BU2-incident."
"After her death,{p15} it was decided to name the park after her."
"Mr Poly speculated that she could have had a connection to Dr Leid."
"Apparently,{p15} her company also has some sketchy business records."
"This led him to talk about the victim having some questionable business as well."
"Mr Poly was also the one to reveal where Ms Holden got the cleaning spray from."
"That's about all Lilian managed to get out of him."

"Funnily enough,{p15} she did discover two holes in the floor,{p15} albeit they weren't usable for that purpose."
"She also assisted by analyzing the fingerprints on the cleaning spray."

"Only the manager and her daughter would have had the means to let someone in there."
"Anyway,{p15} Ms Holden announced her plan to send a limited number of people to the lower floor."
"Lilian managed to convince her to let her come along as well."
"She also managed to confirm that Susan gambled a bit too much for her own good."

"I managed to lose Lilian in the crowd and made my way to the study."

"To get to the auction floor,{p15} we had to go past the guard at the entrance."
"He asked for our IDs and that we step through a metal detector."
"Lilian remembered to take off her pendant,{p15} but I forgot about my gun and triggered the alarm."
"Despite that,{p15} the guard was fine with letting me keep my weapon after I showed it to him."
"He only made sure to add a note of it in his logs,{p15} as per his instructions."
"He then let us proceed without further complications."

"We arrived in Monica Town and went to the lighthouse."
"Ander Cova approached us,{p15} pretending to be a sweets merchant."
"I gave in and bought a cake from him.{p30} The Cova Strawberry Crisis."
"He claimed it had a secret recipe,{p15} but Lilian later exposed that as false."
"He had just bought it from some store somewhere.{p30} Still a good cake,{p15} though."
"Cova mentioned there's high tourism in the area..."
"...thanks to nearby Luna Park and the beautiful coasts."
"He then explained why he disapproved of the auction."
"The previous owner died in the BU-2 incident five years ago."
"This happened while he was attending a dinner party hosted by a certain Mr Ost."
"Everyone in that mansion was declared dead by the police."
"Though they never showed any bodies to the public."
"Their main suspect was another one of the guests,{p15} a female lawyer."
"I'm unsure how they concluded that with no bodies.{p30} Clearly they're hiding something."
"Anyway,{p15} in the following years,{p15} two more people had died after visiting the tower."
"As a result,{p15} the building had been called cursed."
"He also added tales about the eyes on the tower looking at you at night."
"Really trying to sell it to us there."
"Well,{p15} I likely figured out the true nature of the curse already."
"He only wanted to make sure nobody picked up another dangerous item."
"We ignored his warning and entered the tower anyway."

"Lilian and I were catching up during the train ride to the auction."
"She had shown up out of nowhere earlier that day to accompany me."
"Probably just another case of her intuition..."
"Anyway,{p15} we were mostly talking about how our weeks went."
"I had had a really unpleasant encounter with my dentist the day before..."
"...so we had a silly debate about dentists and hairdressers."
"She had also run into my sister the other day,{p15} from the sound of it."
"Sarah is still working for...{p30} I don't want to call him a detective."
"She's trying to work out a certain serial killer case involving a cursed computer file."
"I didn't want her to keep doing that,{p15} but I'm unsure how I feel about it now."
"Meanwhile,{p15} Lilian got involved in another incident in the last few weeks."
"Someone got defenestrated in her apartment building."
"How does she keep managing that?"
"We also talked about the other Queens of Crime."
"There's Claire.{p30} She set up a VR server for us,{p15} all with complete 3D models."
"Always so resourceful.{p30} She'd probably have solved this case by now."
"Ex-Queen Victoria Priston...{p30} Well,{p15} I think nothing else needs to be said about her."
"We replaced her with our newest member,{p15} 'Yevpraksiya',{p15} AKA the Russian Spider."
"We call her that because of the name and the avatar,{p15} but actually don't know where she's from."
"She can be a bit much,{p15} but I trust Claire's recommendation."
"I get along with her fine,{p15} but Lilian doesn't seem to trust her."
"Not too surprising."
"Lastly,{p15} we talked about the auction,{p15} but I dodged most of her questions."
